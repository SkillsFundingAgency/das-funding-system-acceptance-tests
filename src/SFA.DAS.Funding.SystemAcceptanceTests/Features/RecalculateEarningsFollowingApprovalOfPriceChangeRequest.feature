Scenario: Price change - Total price change ONLY - recalc earnings
	Given an apprenticeship has a start date of <start_date>, a planned end date of <end_date>, an agreed price of <agreed_price>, and a training code <training_code>
	And the apprenticeship commitment is approved
	And the total price is above or below or at the funding band maximum
	When SLD record on-programme cost as total price <agreed_price> from date <start_date>
	And SLD record on-programme cost as total price <new_total_price> from date <pc_from_date>
	And SLD submit updated learners details
	Then the earnings are recalculated based on the new instalment amount of <new_inst_amount> from <delivery_period> and <academic_year_string>
	And earnings prior to <delivery_period> and <academic_year_string> are frozen with <old_inst_amount>
	And the history of old earnings is maintained with <old_inst_amount>
	And the AgreedPrice on the earnings entity is updated to <new_total_price>
	And old and new earnings maintain their initial Profile Id

	| start_date      | end_date     | agreed_price | training_code | pc_from_date    | new_total_price | new_inst_amount | academic_year_string | old_inst_amount | delivery_period |
