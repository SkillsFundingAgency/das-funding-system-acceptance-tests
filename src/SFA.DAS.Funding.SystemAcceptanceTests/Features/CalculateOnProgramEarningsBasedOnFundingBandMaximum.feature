Feature: Calculate On program earnings based on funding band maximum

As the ESFA
I want the funding band maximum to be applied  
So we don’t overpay for apprenticeship funding

*** This feature is dependant on FundingBandMax value for the training code used *** 
*** Please do not change it without the consent of the team's testers ***


| Training Code | Earliest Start Date		| Latest End Date		  | Proposed Max Funding |
| 6				| 2014-11-12 00:00:00.000	| 2019-03-03 00:00:00.000 | 27000                |
| 6				| 2019-03-04 00:00:00.000	| NULL					  | 2600                 |

@regression
Scenario: On program earnings generation when agreed price is below funding band max
	Given an apprenticeship has a start date of <start_date>, a planned end date of <planned_end_date>, an agreed price of <agreed_price>, and a training code <training_code>
	When the apprenticeship commitment is approved
	And the agreed price is below the funding band maximum for the selected course
	Then Agreed price is used to calculate the on-program earnings which is divided equally into number of planned months <instalment_amount>
	
Examples:
	| start_date | planned_end_date | agreed_price | training_code | instalment_amount |
	| 2018-08-01 | 2023-07-31       | 26100        | 6             | 1740              |
