Feature: BreakInLearningBreakAndReturnInSameSubmission

As the Dfe
I want the apprenticeship earnings to be recalculated when a break in learning and a return from that break in learning are recorded together
So that the provider acquires earnings only when the learner is not on a break

#@regression
